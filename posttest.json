      "question": "1.Which statements are true regarding lambda rules ?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Proportional scaling for easier circuit understanding",
        "b": "Only layout constraints are introduced",
        "c": "Both proportional scaling and layout constraints are provided",
        "d": "Neither proportional scaling nor layout constraints are provided"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "c",
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Lambda rules do provide proportional scaling, but they also introduce layout constraints, so this is incomplete.",
        "b": "Incorrect. Lambda rules do more than just introduce layout constraints; they also provide proportional scaling.",
        "c": "Correct. Lambda rules provide both proportional scaling and layout constraints, making circuit design easier and more manufacturable.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Lambda rules provide both proportional scaling and layout constraints, so neither is false."

      "correctAnswer": "c",
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. 2/3 is not the standard ratio for minimum allowable width for metal1 and metal2.",
        "b": "Incorrect. 3/4 is not the standard ratio for minimum allowable width for metal1 and metal2.",
        "c": "Correct. The ratio of minimum allowable width for metal1 and metal2 is 4/4.",

      "question": "3.Given a circuit as having polysilicon having width as 1nm and metal with width 4nm and both of them seperated by 7nm ",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Drc rules are satisfied  ",
        "b": "Drc rules fail becuase spacing is too small ",
        "c": "Drc rules fail because metal width is too high ",
        "d": "Drc rules fail becaue polysilicon width is too small  "
      },
      "correctAnswer": "d",
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. In the given circuit, the polysilicon width is 1nm, which is below the typical minimum width for polysilicon in most technology nodes. Therefore, DRC rules would not be satisfied.",
        "b": "Incorrect. The spacing between the polysilicon and metal layers is specified as 7nm, which is typically a reasonable spacing for most technology nodes",
        "c": "Incorrect. The metal width of 4nm does not inherently violate any DRC rules. ",
        "d": "Correct. DRC rules fail because the polysilicon width is too small."

      "question": "4.Which of the following statements are true ",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Micron rules give scalable design ",
        "b": "Micron rules occupy less area ",
        "c": "Thickness rules are also considered as part of layout design ",
        "d": "Layout rules give absolute design "
      },
      "correctAnswer": "b",
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Scalability refers to the ability to easily increase the size or complexity of a design, which depends on various factors beyond just the micron rules.",
        "b": "Correct. Micron rules are guidelines that specify the minimum feature sizes and spacing requirements in the layout design of integrated circuits. By adhering to these rules, designers can ensure that the circuit components are properly placed and spaced, optimizing the use of available area on the chip",
        "c": "Incorrect. While thickness considerations are important in manufacturing, they are typically not directly part of the layout design process. Layout design primarily focuses on the arrangement and connectivity of circuit components rather than the thickness of individual layers.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Layout rules do not give absolute design; they provide constraints within which designers work."
