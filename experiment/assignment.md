1. Select a simple digital circuit or a basic block from a given set of options (e.g., a NAND gate, a flip-flop, or a simple adder). You can also propose your own circuit if you wish, but it should be of similar complexity.

    - Design a layout for the selected circuit/block. Ensure that the layout follows the best practices and guidelines learnt.

    - Consider the Design Rule Checking (DRC) rules specific to the process technology being used. Apply these rules to your layout design to ensure that it meets the required specifications

    - Perform a comprehensive DRC verification on your layout to ensure that it adheres to the specified rules. Record the DRC reports and analyze any violations or errors found.
