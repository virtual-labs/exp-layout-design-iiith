        "d": "Correct. In a MOSFET (Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistor), the transistor gate is formed by the overlap of the polysilicon layer and the active layer. The active layer, also known as the silicon or channel region, is the area where the transistor's current flows when it is in the on-state"

        "a": "Incorrect. While the drain terminal is an important part of a transistor, it is not directly related to the length and width of the transistor itself.",
        "b": "Correct. The gate dimension refers to the length and width of the gate terminal in a transistor. The gate terminal plays a crucial role in controlling the flow of current between the source and drain terminals. By adjusting the length and width of the gate, the transistor's characteristics, such as its threshold voltage and conductivity, can be controlled.",
        "c": "Incorrect. The bulk dimension refers to the physical size of the bulk terminal in a transistor, which is often connected to the substrate or body of the transistor.
