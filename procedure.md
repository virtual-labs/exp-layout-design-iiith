### Steps to Complete the Layout Design

1. **Start the Layout:**

   - Right-click in the workspace to place the first point using the crosshair cursor.
   - Move the cursor to draw the desired shape for your layout.
   - Right-click again to freeze the shape and set the layout region.

2. **Select and Change Components:**

   - Change the component type as needed for your design.

3. **Complete the Layout:**

   - Continue placing and freezing shapes to build the full layout as per your circuit requirements.

4. **Check DRC (Design Rule Check):**

   - Click the **Check DRC** button after completing your layout.
   - The system will automatically verify if your layout satisfies the design rules (DRC).

5. **Review Results:**
   - Observe the results in the observation table.
   - The output will indicate whether DRC rules are satisfied or if there are any violations.

**Note:**

- The values and rules for cross-checking are provided in the theory page. Refer to them for correct dimensions and spacing.
- Use the toolbar and workspace features to adjust and refine your layout as needed.

### Observations

- After clicking the **Check DRC** button, you will see a message indicating whether the DRC rules are satisfied or not.
- The observation table will display details of any rule violations or confirm successful compliance.
- Use the feedback to correct your layout and ensure all design rules are met.
